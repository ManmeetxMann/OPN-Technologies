        <h2>Last revised: July 23rd 2020</h2>
        <p>INTRODUCTION
            OPN Technologies Inc. (“Company” or “we”) respects your privacy and is committed to

            download, register with, access, or use the OPN Mobile Application (the “App”); and
            · Our practices for collecting, using, maintaining, protecting, and disclosing that
            information.
            We will only use your personal information in accordance with this policy unless otherwise
            required by applicable law. We take steps to ensure that the personal information that we collect
            about you is adequate, relevant, not excessive, and used for limited purposes.
            Please read this policy carefully to understand our policies and practices for collecting,
            processing, and storing your information. If you do not agree with our policies and practices,
            do not download, register with, or use the App.
            By downloading, registering with, or using this App, you indicate that you understand, accept,
            and consent to the practices described in this privacy policy.
            This policy may change from time to time (see Changes to Our Privacy Policy ). Your continued
            use of this App after we make changes indicates that you accept and consent to those changes, so
            please check the policy periodically for updates.</p>

            <p>
            <h3>INFORMATION WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU AND HOW WE COLLECT IT</h3>
            We collect information about you through:
            · Direct interactions with you when you provide it to us, for example, by uploading
            photos, completing self-attestation forms, responding to questions, or corresponding with
            us.
            · Automated technologies or interactions, when you use the App, for example, usage
            details, IP addresses, and information collected about your location.
            We may collect and use the following information about you:
            · Your name, birth year, photo(s) that you provide to us, email address, recent travel
            history, and information related to your health (collectively, “personal information”).</p>
            
            <h3>2</h3>
            <p>
            · Non-personal information that does not directly or indirectly reveal your identity or
            directly relate to an identifiable individual, such as demographic information, or
            statistical or aggregated information. We may derive non-personal statistical or
            aggregated data from personal information. For example, we may aggregate personal
            information to calculate the demographics of users accessing a specific feature of the
            App.
            · Technical information, including your login information, device type, time zone setting,
            and usage details.
            
            Information You Provide to Us
            When you download, register with, or use this App, we ask you to provide:
            · Information by filling in forms in the App. For example, when you use this App to
            gain entry to a location you will be asked to complete a self-attestation form. We use this
            information to provide you, the organizations to which you are connected on the App,
            and such organizations’ administrator(s), with your current access status. That access
            status, which is used by your connected organizations’ administrator(s) to permit or deny
            you access to a location, is derived from your responses to the self-attestation form.
            · Information about your connected organizations. A connected organization is
            typically a company, institution, or other business that you (i) have a pre-existing
            relationship with and/or (ii) are seeking to physically enter. One example of a connected
            organization could be your employer/place of work. Another example of a connected
            organization could be a restaurant or retailer that you want to enter.
            · Information about your location from time to time. We use this information to
            determine which locations, buildings or facilities you are trying to enter.
            · Information when you report a problem with the App. We use this information to
            troubleshoot and help correct performance issues.
            
            In the future, we may also ask you to provide additional information about your health so that we
            can provide you, your connected organizations and their administrator(s), and other third parties
            with updates relating to your health status. We will always ask for your consent before we
            collect, use, or distribute such personal health information.
